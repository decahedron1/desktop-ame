# Desktop Ame
Ame that lives in your computer and messes with your programs

[Inspired by walfie](https://twitter.com/walfieee/status/1387243492758495235)

Ame will randomly minimize your desktop windows every 3.5-60 seconds.

## Closing Desktop Ame
Ame won't (can't) minimize task manager by default, so you can stop her that way, or right click the tray icon and click close there.
