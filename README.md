# Desktop Ame
Ame that lives in your computer and messes with your programs

Ame will randomly minimize your desktop windows every 3.5-60 seconds.

## Running
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/sudo-carson/desktop-ame/releases/latest) and run it. If you run into SmartScreen, click more info and run anyway.

Ame can't detect some programs (e.g. File Explorer) and can't minimize some programs (e.g. Task Manager) without administrator privileges. Admin privileges aren't required but allow Ame to truly mess with *all* your programs.

If it doesn't seem to be working, make sure the tray icon is on your taskbar (you may need to expand the caret thingy). If it isn't you'll need [the .NET 4.7.2 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472).

Desktop Ame does **not** work with Linux, and I have no plans to port it to Linux.

## Closing Desktop Ame
Ame won't (can't) minimize task manager by default, so you can stop her that way, or right click the tray icon and click close there.
